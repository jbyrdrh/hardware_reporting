**Hardware Reporting**

This demo shows you how you can take an empty hardware report template file and populate it with ansible facts.
It also adds the 'NONE' value if a particular disk does not exist on a given virtual machine.

NOTE: This demo is basic, but it's a great building block for learning Ansible and can be combined with other concepts.
