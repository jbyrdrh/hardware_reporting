**Hardware Reporting**

This demo shows you how you can take an empty hardware report template file on `controlnode`, `hwreport.empty`, copy to the managed nodes as `hwreport.txt`, and then populate it with the gathered ansible facts.
It also adds the `NONE` value if a particular disk does not exist on a given virtual machine.

NOTE: Even though this demo is basic, it is a great building block for learning Ansible and can be combined with other concepts.
